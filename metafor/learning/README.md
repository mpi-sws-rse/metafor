# Learning from Simulation Data   



## ðŸ“¦ Data Generation    

To generate data:    

```bash
cd data_generation/   
python data_generator.py  --runs=100   
```
To generate data in multiserver setting:    

```bash 
python data_generator_multi.py  --runs=10
```

This generates a file "discrete_results.pdf" which shows the average 
queue length and latency for the simulations. We can infer metastability from 
these plots as well.

The above command generates a dataset consisting of $runs$ number of csv files.   
Similarly, other arguments can be passed to the data generator file.   
To ensure backward compatibility, the pkl files can be generated by adding    
"--genpkl=True" to the above command.   

## ðŸš€ Visualize the data    

To visuzalize the queue length across all runs:   
Set the $feature$ variable to queue_length and run    

```bash 
python data_visualization.py    
```
